# sinGAN reload

sinGAN reload is a PyTorch reimplementation of the paper "SinGAN: Learning a Generative Model from a Single Natural Image" (ICCV 2019, [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf)). It enables users to transfer a paint into a realistic image.

## Project Prototype

We intend to re-implement the paint-to-image task from SinGan, and extend the application to digital pathology use case. Furthermore, we aim to provide a user-friendly frontend platform for the above mentioned image manipulation tasks. 

## Installation
TODO

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage
TODO
```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
